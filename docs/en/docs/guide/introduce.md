You are currently browsing the configuration documentation for the `reco` theme `2.x`.

In the past, theme `reco` has been supported by many friends, I am very honored, it changed my life, and I also made a lot of friends. But I don't think it is professional and flexible, and sometimes some advanced features require certain professionalism. I know that this is not easy for some Non-FE professional friends.

I hope the theme can be more out of the box, open and flexible, and inherit "simple" concept, give back to all friends. Come and tell me what you want it to be!
